# projectile-plotter
A very-simple micro-framework with three programming languages included demonstrating a projectile's motion plot.

## How does it work?
- `/lib` - This is where libraries are located, using which program will be able to perform


  * `plot.py`


    > This file uses Matplolib to create the plot.
  * `projectile.js`


    > In this file, all you see is math! calculations in here.
  * `Run.pl`


    > This module is where the connection between Plot and Calculations is going to be possible.
- `/src`
  * `main.pl`

    > This file handles the running proccess!
- `main.sh`
> This script is just a shortcut for `main.pl`!
